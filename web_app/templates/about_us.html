        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Save The Stray! We are committed to improving road safety for stray animals and ensuring their well-being using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and machine learning. Our goal is not only to prevent road accidents but also to provide a safer and more comfortable environment for stray animals. This project combines hardware, software, and community support to create an impactful solution.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of Our Project</h2>

                <h3>Feeding Stations for Stray Animals</h3>
                <p>Our system includes strategically placed **feeding stations** along the roads, far from traffic, which are equipped with sensors. These stations are designed to automatically detect stray animals using IR or motion sensors. Once an animal is detected, the system activates the dispenser to provide food and water for the animals. This ensures that stray animals have access to basic necessities, especially in areas with limited resources.</p>

                <h3>Animal Detection and Road Safety</h3>
                <p>Using advanced **AI and IoT** technologies, our system continuously monitors roads for the presence of animals. When an animal is detected, the system triggers a series of actions to prevent accidents. This includes activating **sound and light deterrents** to guide animals off the road and **road caution signs** to warn drivers. This real-time system aims to prevent collisions and save lives, both human and animal.</p>

                <h3>Photo Upload for NGO Help</h3>
                <p>Our platform allows users to upload photos of stray animals they encounter on the road. By submitting these photos, the community can help identify animals in need of assistance and connect them with local NGOs and animal welfare groups. The uploaded images are shared with the relevant organizations for immediate action, ensuring that no animal is left behind.</p>

                <h3>Real-Time Alerts and Notifications</h3>
                <p>Our website provides real-time alerts and notifications about animals detected on highways. These alerts are sent to drivers through a dedicated app or website interface, allowing them to take necessary precautions when approaching animal-prone areas. Our goal is to reduce accidents by ensuring drivers are aware of animal presence in advance.</p>
