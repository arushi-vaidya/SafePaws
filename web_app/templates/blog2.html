                A balanced diet is crucial for animals, providing all the necessary nutrients they need for energy, growth, and overall health. The key components of a balanced diet include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Help build and repair muscles and tissues. Found in meat, fish, and eggs.</li>
                <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Provide energy and aid in absorbing vitamins. Include sources like fish oil and poultry fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamins & Minerals:</strong> Support immune systems, strengthen bones, and enhance metabolism.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Regularly consult with a veterinarian to ensure your animal's diet aligns with their specific needs, age, and lifestyle.

                Some animals require specialized diets due to their age, medical conditions, or unique needs. Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Senior Animals:</strong> Lower calorie diets with added fiber help manage weight and digestion.</li>
                <li><strong>Pregnant or Nursing Animals:</strong> Require calorie-dense, protein-rich diets to support growth and lactation.</li>
                <li><strong>Allergic Animals:</strong> Hypoallergenic diets eliminate common allergens like grains, soy, and dairy.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Needs:</strong> Special prescription diets manage conditions such as kidney disease or diabetes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Gradually introduce any new diet to prevent digestive issues and monitor for adverse reactions.

                <li><strong>Engage Them:</strong> Use puzzle feeders or scatter food to encourage mental stimulation and natural foraging behavior.</li>
