<!-- How it works section -->
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
    By uploading a picture of a stray animal, you help us track and manage the safety of animals on the streets. 
    Here's how it works:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Enter the Location:</strong> Provide the location where the stray animal was spotted. This helps in mapping the animals' positions for better monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Select a Picture:</strong> Choose a clear picture of the animal. This image will be stored in our database for further analysis and tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Upload:</strong> Once you submit the form, the picture will be uploaded, and the location information will be saved for future reference and action.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Your contribution plays a vital role in helping prevent road accidents and ensuring the safety of stray animals. Thank you for your support!
